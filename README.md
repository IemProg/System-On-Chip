# System-On-Chip
Display output of Infra-red camera on LCD screen controled by playstation joysticks embedded on Cyclone-V using C/VHDL 


This project comes as course project throught System-On-Chip Course (CS-309) at EPFL, where we have to develop a project by using skills and modules we 
developed during laboratories.


# Hardware:
1 - Lepton Flir Infrared Camera (9Mhz; 80x64 pixels)

2 - Playstation Joysticks

3 - MCP3203: Analog to Digital Converter

4 - LCD Screen

5 - Cyclone V SoC with Dual-core ARM Cortex-A9 (HPS)

For more details about the architecture, and code, check the reports.
